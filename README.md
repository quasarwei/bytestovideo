# bytestovideo

Two simple Processing programs that
  1. loads a file as bytes and writes them into a txt file
  2. reads numbers from a txt file and converts values to color and displays as video
  
The 2nd file is pretty basic, I'm not sure how much variation you can get from different files,
but I'm sure other people can build onto it using more creative processes and get more interesting results. 
Another interesting interesting method is to use bit-shifting on video (which you can load and display via PGraphics). 
I'll try to clean up, improve and upload another project which does just that. 

There's a sample text file you can begin playing with. 

You can also find some examples here (they should be tagged with "processing"):
